## 🎯 Objectives of the Thesis

1. **Develop a semantic and syntactic plagiarism detection system** using transformer-based models (e.g., MiniLM, SBERT).
2. **Build a paraphrase generation module** using both pre-trained and fine-tuned generative models (e.g., BART, DeepSeek).
3. **Compare and evaluate multiple approaches** for both detection and paraphrasing based on accuracy, similarity scores, and qualitative output.
4. **Demonstrate real-world applicability** by incorporating web scraping and similarity matching across online sources.

## 📊 Datasets
PAN 2011: Used for supervised plagiarism detection.
PAWS-Wiki: Used for paraphrase model fine-tuning.
Custom Sentences: Manually created for paraphrase evaluation and robustness testing.

## 📌 Highlights
Fine-tuned transformer models (BART, MiniLM) on domain-specific data.
Developed hybrid similarity scoring using both lexical and semantic features.
Implemented real-time web scraping to compare online content against suspect input.
Designed reusable pipelines for both plagiarism detection and paraphrasing tasks.
Achieved high accuracy and semantic retention across multiple evaluation thresholds.
