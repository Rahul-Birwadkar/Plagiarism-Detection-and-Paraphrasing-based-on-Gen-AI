This repository contains the complete implementation, thesis documentation, and presentation for my master's thesis project:  
**"Plagiarism Detection and Paraphrasing Based on Generative Artificial Intelligence"**

## üéØ Objectives of the Thesis

1. **Develop a semantic plagiarism detection system** using transformer-based models (e.g., MiniLM, SBERT).
2. **Build a paraphrase generation module** using both pre-trained and fine-tuned generative models (e.g., BART, DeepSeek).
3. **Compare and evaluate multiple approaches** for both detection and paraphrasing based on accuracy, similarity scores, and qualitative output.
4. **Demonstrate real-world applicability** by incorporating web scraping and similarity matching across online sources.
